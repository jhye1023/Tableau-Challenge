### Analysis

#### Station Popularity

* The 10 start and end stations can be found in New Jersey zipcode 07302 and 07303. I believe the stations are found here since the area is mostly residential homes and have bike lanes so people use the bike for their commute.

#### The Trends Between Customers and Subscribers.

* The trends are similar between customers and subscribers. In the winter, the number of users decreased due to the weather and then more decreased due to the influence of COVID-19 in March, but it has been on the rise ever since ( The Data is without unknown gender).

#### Gender Composition

* Currently, the largest number of users are men, but the trend of increase and decrease moves together regardless of gender.

#### Birth Year

* The most rider population's birth year group is the 1980's but the longest average trip duration's birth year group is the 2000's.

#### Peak Time

* Bike riders were the most during the commute time. In winter, the number of riders tends to decrease at peak times due to the weather, and in May and June, the number of riders does not seem to have increased significantly due to the influence of COVID-19 at the peak time.
